# 3. For each of the following pairs of scanf format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If theyâ€™re not, show how they can be distinguished.

## (a) "%d" versus " %d"

### They're equivalent.
#### %d reads an integer, but it will skip leading whitespace automatically (spaces, newlines, tabs).

## (b) "%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d -%d"

### Not equivalent.
#### In scanf, non-whitespace characters in the format string (like -) must match exactly.

### "%d-%d-%d"
```c
12-34-56
```

### "%d -%d -%d"
```c
12 -34 -56
```

## (c) "%f" versus "%f "

### Not equivalent.
#### "%f" reads one floating-point number. Stops at the first non-numeric character.
#### "%f " the space at the end means: after reading the float, skip whitespace and wait for a non-whitespace character.

## (d) "%f,%f" versus "%f, %f"

### Not equivalent.
#### "%f,%f" requires the comma to appear immediately after the first number, no spaces.
#### "%f, %f" allows spaces after the comma.
#### Example: 12.3,45.6 and 12.4, 45.6
