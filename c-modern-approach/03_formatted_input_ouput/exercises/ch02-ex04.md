# 4. Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

```c
scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);
```

### If the user enters
```bash
10.3 5 6
```

### What will be the values of i, x, and j after the call? (Assume that i and j are int variables and x is a float variable.)
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int i, j;
  float x;

  scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);

  printf("i: %d, x: %.1f, j: %d\n", i, x, j);

  return 0;
}
```
### Output:

```bash
i = 10, x =  0.3, j = 5
```
